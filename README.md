# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration | A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly
# Phonepe
The Indian digital payments story has truly captured the world's imagination. From the largest towns to the remotest villages, there is a payments revolution being driven by the penetration of mobile phones, mobile internet and state-of-the-art payments infrastructure built as Public Goods championed by the central bank and the government. Founded in December 2015, PhonePe has been a strong beneficiary of the API driven digitisation of payments in India. When we started, we were constantly looking for granular and definitive data sources on digital payments in India. PhonePe Pulse is our way of giving back to the digital payments ecosystem.
# Phonepe Pulse
PhonePe, India's leading fintech platform, announced the launch of PhonePe Pulse, India's first interactive website with data, insights and trends on digital payments in the country. The PhonePe Pulse website showcases more than 2000+ Crore transactions by consumers on an interactive map of India. With  over 45% market share, PhonePe's data is representative of the country's digital payment habits.

The insights on the website and in the report have been drawn from two key sources - the entirety of PhonePe's transaction data combined with merchant and customer interviews. The report is available as a free download on the PhonePe Pulse website and GitHub.
   
# Problem Statement        
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
# Overview 
In this streamlit web app you can visualize the phonepe pulse data and gain lot of insights on transactions, number of users, top 10 state, district, pincode and which brand has most number of users and so on. Bar charts, Pie charts and Geo map visualization are used to get some insights.
# Take Away Skills
The following skills were acquired from the project: 
- GITHUB CLONING
- PYTHON
- PANDAS
- MYSQL
- STREAMLIT
- PLOTLY

# Work Flow
- Data extraction: 
Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
- Data transformation:
Utilise libraries like Pandas and a scripting language like Python to alter and pre-process the data. This could entail preparing missing numbers, cleaning the data, and formatting it so that it can be used for analysis and visualisation.
- Database insertion:
Use the "sqlalchemy" library in Python to insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
- Dashboard creation:
Create an engaging and eye-catching dashboard using Python by utilising the Streamlit and Plotly modules. The data may be shown on a map using Plotly's built-in geolocation features, and Streamlit can be used to make an intuitive user interface with several dropdown menus so that users can choose which facts and figures to show.
- Data retrieval:
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
- Deployment:
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
# Usage of App
After the project has been successfully set up and activated, users can interact with the Streamlit application through a web browser. Through the application's user-friendly interface, users can carry out the following tasks: 
- The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics ,fetch data and preprocess it.
- Gather information and keep it in a SQL data warehouse for numerous metrics.
- Check out the uploaded transaction / user details.
- Utilise a variety of search tools to locate and retrieve data from a SQL database.
- Use these integrated features and geo visualisation techniques to perform analysis and visualisation of pulse data.
# Conclusion
The goal of this project is to give a complete and intuitive solution for data extraction, transformation, and visualisation from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, delivering insightful information for analysis and decision-making.
